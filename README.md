# Assignment Overview:

In your first assignment, you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple,
published on the web.

You will create a simple website that will showcase one of your passions. This
is not about making the website flashy, but more about focusing on creating a
website and learning your new tools.

## Objectives

- Get to know your text editor
- Introduce yourself to working on the command line
- Write some HTML
- Publish a web page

## Requirements

- If you have experience with existing HTML/CSS frameworks (bootstrap, Bulma, etc) you may _not_ use them for these assignments.

### Explorer Mode

- [x] use `app-app HelloWorld` to create your first website.
- [x] Compose a short essay (just a couple paragraphs at most) about a hobby you either enjoy or would like to learn about. We might expand on this page in future assignments, so pick something fun!
- [x] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML elements. Give your webpage a simple header and footer as well.
- [x] Deploy your site.

Now that you have created some HTML, its time to give your page some personality.

For this assignment you will be taking the HTML you made for the last project and extending it to have some styling.

### Requirements

- Apply the ideas and stylings that you learn about in class.

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Take the CSS ideas and tools that were discussed in class and apply those to your homework.
- [x] Apply colors, margin, padding, background colors, and font styles to the various elements of the page. Add `class=` where needed but try to keep to element selectors if you can!

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Research fonts.google.com and find an alternative font, or two, for your site. Use two different fonts (but no more than two) to style different aspects of your page. Maybe headers in one font and text in another.
