          There’s a common misconception that analog photography is a thing of
          the past, but nothing could be further from the truth! I am here to
          tell you that analog photography is still alive and well today and I
          hope I can cover some information on how it is still relevant in the
          digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start let’s answer some of the most pressing questions about analog
          photography:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <em>
            <li>
              “Can you even get film today?”
            </li>
            <li>
              “Who develops film anymore nowadays?”
            </li>
            <li>
              “Why shoot film? Digital can do everything film can!?”
            </li>
          </em>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ahh yes... The most common question I get about analog photography,
          the lack of clarity on its availability of resources. Would you be
          surprised to know that most Walmart and CVS stores carry a pack of
          film? It’s true! Most of these places usually carry one or two brands
          of typical ISO 200, 400, and 800 film stocks. Have you ever seen those
          disposable cameras that people used back in the day? Those disposable
          cameras are cheap film cameras that have those film stocks I
          mentioned. Yep, that’s still a thing and you can find them at Walmart,
          usually in the aisle where you find memory cards and batteries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two film giants in today’s world usually come down to Kodak and
          Fuji and you can be damn sure that they still make film! Now the film
          stocks you would find in these local stores may seem to lack quality
          due to its appeal to regular consumers. However, outside of the
          retail, most online photography stores carry other film stocks that
          are professional-grade. Kodak is a really good example of a company
          that primarily thrives on selling film. And they make really good ones
          that I find are some of my favorites like Kodak BW Tri-X 400 film and
          Kodak Color Portra 400. Fun fact… Did you know Kodak supplies film for
          a lot of movies that are released today? Yep, there are still many
          movie directors that prefer to shoot film for their movies, some of
          them include directors like Quentin Tarantino (The Hateful Eight
          2015), Christopher Nolan (Interstellar 2013), and Rian Johnson (Star
          Wars: The Last Jedi 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
          So to surmise, yes film is still available and widely available on the
          online market. They are not as readily available as it used to be
          before, but they are around if you know where to look.

        <p>
          There are usually two options that are available when it comes to
          developing films:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send them out to a lab</li>
          <li>Develop them on your own</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Let’s talk about labs… The availability is not the same as it used to
          be. With the rise of digital photography, most of these labs have lost
          their place in the world because to the average consumer, film
          photography has been replaced by iPhones and digital cameras. But that
          doesn’t mean they don’t exist. There are still many labs that are
          still developing film across the country and they are not going away
          anytime soon (We’ll discuss more when we get to the film vs digital
          part). However, keep in mind that most CVS’ still take films and
          process them. Although I don’t recommend it because of their quality
          of scans, more on that soon…
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest change in the delivery of photos in the digital age is
          that they are delivered in a digital format (usually by large email
          attachments). Receiving physical prints isn’t as common as they used
          to be mainly due to the paradigm shift of how photos are treated in
          the digital era. Most people keep their photos on their phones,
          computers, or hard drives. However, most if not all labs still deliver
          photos as prints. But the most common option is to receive them
          digitally. So it’s pretty common to send out film to get it processed
          than going to a local lab. That covers the first option, now to the
          next…
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing your film... Although an uncommon practice, it is still
          done today. Chemicals, tools, and information are still available to
          the public on how to develop your film. If you’re like me, some people
          like to use enlargers to print on photo papers than using a digital
          printer. Which brings me to the biggest point on why people choose to
          send film out over developing your own…
        </p>
        <p>
          Digitizing film is a whole beast on its own. It’s a very complicated
          realm to dive into and resources and information aren’t as easy to
          find. This would be a topic for another time but let’s simplify this
          point by saying:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Films are digitized using special film scanners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some scanners are extremely expensive — and we’re talking $10,000
            and up. A good lab is determined by how good their scanners are and
            the expertise of the person using it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scanning films is a whole art on its own and it takes a lot of
            practice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Due to these reasons, it’s usually easier to send films out to labs
          and let them take care of the scanning. Looking at how labs scan their
          film is a common practice in the analog community. The biggest
          challenge here is not about finding a lab that develops film, but
          rather finding a lab that can provide you with really good scans if
          you care about the quality and the look of your photos. Now let’s
          segue into the next point while we’re on the topic of scans…

        <p>
          So by now, you’re probably wondering… “Kento, film looks like it’s a
          lot of work! Why shoot film over digital? Digital is so much more
          simple and less expensive!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah... reader, that’s a very common question I get all the time. Let me
          ask you this…
        </p>
        <ul>
          <em>
            <li>
              Why listen to vinyl, when you have Spotify?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why cook your nice 5-star meal, when you can just go to a 5-star
              restaurant?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why drive a manual, when automatic is easier?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why buy a book, if you have a Kindle?
            </li>
          </em>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If any of those questions apply to you, you might be thinking
          something along the lines of ‘experience’. Music enthusiasts listen to
          vinyl for the raw sound of the songs. For those who like to cook at
          home, it’s a whole new experience to share with someone else. Car
          enthusiasts drive a manual because it makes you feel like you’re
          ‘really’ driving by being connected to the car. People read a physical
          paper book for the tactile feeling of the pages. It’s all the same
          concept for analog photography. There’s a sense of wholesomeness in
          the process of going back to the bare basics of how photography works.
          The physical element of film is a unique experience and to some more
          challenging than its digital counterpart.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, that is not all there is to shooting film, it has its
          benefits as well. Let me list a few of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Film makes you slow down and being mindful of taking photos, as
              you are limited by the number of photos you can take per film.
              Some common numbers as a reference:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>35mm: 27 or 36 images per roll</li>
              <li>120mm (medium format): 9 to 16 images per roll</li>
              <li>4x5 or 8x10 (large format) sheet film: 1 photo per sheet</li>
              <li>Digital Nikon D800: 700+ images per 32GB CF card</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is drastically different in comparison to the hundreds of
              photos a digital camera can take and store on to a memory card. To
              some people, they find this to be a benefit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Film has a very specific ‘look’ that is difficult to replicate
              from a digital camera. There’s a huge difference in the ‘look’
              between two platforms. Digital is a medium of perfection. It’s
              very precise, sharp, and has a wider dynamic range of colors to
              work with. Film on the other hand is a medium of imperfection.
              It’s grainy, nostalgic, and raw. As a result, it provides a very
              unique ‘look’ that digital cameras have a hard time replicating
              because of its sense of ‘imperfectness’ and some people like that.
              Also unlike digital, film has a narrow dynamic range. However,
              this acts as a benefit because its ability to interpret shadows
              and colors feel more natural than digital. The film ‘look’ is so
              popular that there are a lot of digital filters to get that film
              look. People have been trying to perfect the ‘film look’ filter
              for the last decade that it’s become a market. There are lots of
              companies and individuals who create Adobe Lightroom presets to
              turn their digital photos into film look-a-likes. You can thank
              Instagram filters for this obsession!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Film for the longest time dominated the quality battle against
              digital. To understand this you have to comprehend the idea of
              film sizes and their impact on quality. Let’s break this down:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Digital cameras have sensors where the image is projected by
                  the lens. Once projected, the image gets recorded ultimately
                  turning it into a digital image. Film works the same way,
                  except instead of a digital sensor film IS the sensor.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The bigger the film (or sensor) the higher the quality. This
                  is because the larger the film, the more information it can
                  store. This type of measurement is what we call megapixels.
                  This is why large format cameras that take 4x5 film or 8x10
                  film are the highest quality cameras on the market. There is
                  no digital equivalent of sensors that are as big as those
                  sheet films. Even with medium format 120mm film, for digital
                  cameras to have sensors that big, you are looking to spend at
                  least $10,000 on a Hasselblad digital back camera. Most
                  pro-sumer digital cameras you find on the market have sensors
                  that are around the size of a 35mm film hence the lower
                  quality. However digital camera technology has advanced
                  throughout the years where their smaller sensors can record
                  more information. There are limitations to this because the
                  larger the megapixels, the more memory it requires. And this
                  is usually capped by the current state of technological
                  progress on memory card capacities.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                  Ironically, the older the camera, the higher the quality. This
                  is because photographers used larger films that were clunky
                  and difficult to use. Through out the years, they focused on
                  making cameras smaller by sacrificing the quality of images.
                  This meant that digital cameras focused on the idea of
                  ‘compactness’. Companies have not focused not on the size of
                  the sensors but rather making small and compact cameras that
                  can store more photos. With film, this isn’t so much of an
                  issue and it’s cheaper than spending $10,000+ on a camera that
                  can do so. But this is changing with how technology is
                  progressing today.

          There are more reasons for the benefits of shooting film but those are
          some major points to why people still shoot them today. Analog
          photography is everywhere, you just don’t realize it. Next time when
          you think of works by Richard Avedon for Vogue, Annie Leibovitz for
          The Rolling Stones, Cassandra Klos for Time, Steve McCurry for
          National Geographic, Ansel Adams and Clyde Butcher for their
          influential landscape photography, or even most elite photographers in
          the wedding industry all shot film as their medium.
